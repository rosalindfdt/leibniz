# SYNTAX
```
f(x) := f(x^2)
f' should return 2x
df/dx should also return 2x

f(x) := f(x^2)
F should return x^3 /3 +c
F' should return x^2
dF/dx should also return x^2 (or dF?)
F[0,1] should return 1/3 
```
```f(x) = f(x^2)``` what do?

# ALGEBRA SHIT
x^3 / 3 = x cubed on 3
x^3/3 = x to the 3/3

x ^ 3 / 3 should yell at you
x ^3 = what to the 3?
x^ 3 = x to the what?
x ^ 3 = what to the what?

Ashe: "x^3 -1/3 / 3"?

possibility:
